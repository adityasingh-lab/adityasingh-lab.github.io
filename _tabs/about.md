Hello Tech Enthusiasts,

Thank you for visiting my page. I'm Aditya, boasting approximately 14 years of experience in the IT field. My career commenced as an 'Assistant System Engineer - Trainee' at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in Bengaluru (KA, India), starting in Nov-2010. I served as an offshore Business-as-Usual (BAU) resource for a US-based financial company, where my responsibilities included supporting and managing the lower environment. My support portfolio encompassed technologies such as IBM DataPower (XI50, firmware v3.x), WMB, WMQ, Sterling Integrator/Sterling File Gateway, and Connect-Direct. Coming from a non-computer science and non-IT engineering background, the plethora of applications was initially overwhelming. I distinctly recall my first encounter with XML and subsequently related languages like WSDL, XSLT, and XSDs. Being a part of the BAU team necessitated learning automation, prompting me to acquire skills in programming languages such as Java, Perl, shell/bash, and gain hands-on experience in other technological areas like Linux, mainframes, etc. My inaugural task as a BAU resource involved certificate renewal on DataPower and executing deployments for the aforementioned technologies.

During my tenure in TCS, I participated in several migration projects such as **XI50 to XG45**, **datacenter transitions**, automation of daily appliance transactions, and development on DataPower, which included work on **Web Service Proxy (WSP)**, **Multi-Protocol Gateway (MPGW)**, and **XML Firewall (XMLFW)**.

In 2014, I joined Cognizant as an offshore developer for DataPower and IBM API Management, for clients from domains in banking and financial, and healthcare for US region. In 2016, I relocated to the UK to establish IBM middleware infrastructure. My responsibilities included setting up **IBM API Management v4**, **IBM DataPower gateways** (both **virtual** and **physical**), and supporting MQ/IIB installations. This project marked my first visit to an actual data center . During this time, I was responsible for configuring the environment from development to production, establishing development and design standards, and implementing a DevOps pipeline.

After my project ended, I returned to Bengaluru (KA, India) in March 2017 to work from offshore as an IBM API Connect and IBM DataPower developer for a US-based banking client. By the end of the year, I had the opportunity again to relocate to the UK as an API-Connect developer. The initial project entailed developing APIs for Account Management and Payment in accordance with the PSD2 open-banking standards, incorporating security protocols like OpenID-Connect, OAuth2.0 , JWT, message validation, and policies for connecting to IBM MQ.

I have also developed user-defined policies for injection checks, such as SQL Injection and XSS checks. These policies have been beneficial, in addition to other enforced authentication standards like mutual-TLS v2 and message validation. Additionally, I have been involved in DataPower/API-Connect provisioning, which included splitting the environment and integrating additional DataPower/API-Connect instances in the non-production environment, migration of IBM middleware environment to IBM CP4I hosted on RedHat Openshift (AWS).

At the end of October 2022, I had the opportunity to join Prolifics, where I contributed to migrations from API-Connect v5 to v10, v2018 to v10 and DataPower v2018 to v10. I provided interim support for classified clients. Additionally, I was involved in Azure cloud as technical lead, which required face-to-face client consultations to understand their needs, and the creation of design documents (HLDs/LLDs). These documents covered network design (e.g., VNet, VPN, public/private endpoints), subscriptions, security, and resources (such as serverless functions, Logic Apps, ADF, Azure Storage, MySQL, API Management, Service Bus) along with their SKUs.

Apart from above, I also enjoy sightseeing, campaigning, bike ride, cooking, table-tennis, gym.
