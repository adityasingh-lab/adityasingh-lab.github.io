Hello Tech Enthusiasts,

You’re here to address the challenge of securing your APIs with JWT generation/validation policy in IBM API Connect. This series of articles will concentrate on the widely requested use of X.509 RSA certificates/keys for signing and verification. I’ll tackle this with a straightforward method, and if you have a more complex requirement, leave your comments, and I’ll craft an article for it. In part 1 of this series, we’ll generate a certificate using DataPower cryptographic tools and upload it to the IBM API Connect Manager UI. Parts-2 and Part-3 will focus on JWT generation and validation, respectively.

> JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. Refer JSON Web Token Introduction — jwt.io.

## Prerequisites
- IBM API Connect — v10.0.5.x (hereafter referred as APIC)
- IBM DataPower Gateway (API Gateway) — 10.5.0.x. (hereafter referred as DataPower)
- Postman — 11.11.1: For testing JWT generation and validation. Feel free to use any testing tool you prefer.
- Certificate/Key Pair: I’ve utilized DataPower cryptographic tools to generate self-sign certificate, but OpenSSL is also an option. In case you’re using pre-defined certificate, you can ignore the step-1

## Step 1: Generate Self-Sign Certificate

In BAU world, operation team does uses DataPower Crypto tools on day-to-day basis to generate CSR/key pair for CA signed certificate request other than openssl. Here are quick steps:

- Login to DataPower web console (Prefer New UI as the existing is now deprecated. Something I’ll miss for sure!)
- Search for Crypto tools and fill out Common-Name (keeping other fields empty and rest setting to default). Click Submit.
