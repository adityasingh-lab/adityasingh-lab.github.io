Hello Tech Enthusiasts 👋,

You’re here to address the challenge of securing your APIs with JWT generation/validation policy in IBM API Connect. This series of articles will concentrate on the widely requested use of X.509 RSA certificates/keys for signing and verification. I’ll tackle this with a straightforward method, and if you have a more complex requirement, leave your comments, and I’ll craft an article for it. In part 1 of this series, we’ll generate a certificate using DataPower cryptographic tools and upload it to the IBM API Connect Manager UI. [Parts-2](https://adityasingh-lab.github.io/posts/apic-jwt-p2/){:target="_blank"} and [Part-3](https://adityasingh-lab.github.io/apic-jwt-p3/){:target="_blank"} will focus on JWT generation and validation, respectively.

> JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. Refer JSON Web Token Introduction — [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/introduction){:target="_blank"}.

## Prerequisites

- IBM API Connect — v10.0.5.x (hereafter referred as APIC)
- IBM DataPower Gateway (API Gateway) — 10.5.0.x. (hereafter referred as DataPower)
- Postman — 11.11.1: For testing JWT generation and validation. Feel free to use any testing tool you prefer.
- Certificate/Key Pair: I’ve utilized DataPower cryptographic tools to generate self-sign certificate, but OpenSSL is also an option. In case you’re using pre-defined certificate, you can ignore the step-1

## Step 1: Generate Self-Sign Certificate

In BAU world, operation team does uses DataPower Crypto tools on day-to-day basis to generate CSR/key pair for CA signed certificate request other than openssl. Here are quick steps:

- Logon to DataPower web console (Prefer New UI as the existing is now deprecated. Something I’ll miss for sure!)
- Search for Crypto tools and fill out Common-Name (keeping other fields empty and rest setting to default). Click Submit.

- The certificates are stored in temporary folder. Download the public/private certificate.

## Step 2: Upload the Certificate in APIC TLS Profile

- Go to api-manager-ui → Resources → TLS
- Create a new Keystore `JWT Keystore` and upload private and public key
- Create a TLS Client Profile `JWT Keyprofile` and select ‘JWT Keystore’
- Go to Manage → Catalog (I’m using Sandbox as my catalog here) → Catalog setting → TLS client profiles.
- Click Edit and select `JWT-Keyprofile`

The aforementioned step will generate cryptographic certificate and key objects in DataPower (refer to the screenshot below). These will be utilized in the generation and validation of JWTs.

**The file names are in following format:**

_private-key file_: \<apim-organization\>\_\<catalog\>\_tlsp-\<apim-tlsclientprofile\>V\<version\>-key

_public-cert file_: \<apim-organization\>\_\<catalog\>\_tlsp-\<apim-tlsclientprofile\>V\<version\>-ca-\<sequence number\>

**In my case,**

- _apim-organization_ : `personal`
- _catalog_: `sandbox`
- _apim-clientprofile_: `jwt-keyprofile` (what we created in above steps)
- _version_: `1.0.0` (you can see this from api-manager ui)
- _cert sequence number_: This should `0`. The incremental is based on in case you add truststore file as well.
